# BotAI integration contract

Status: FROZEN v1.6, 2026-10-05. Implemented contract; current verification and remaining browser gate: [RESUME](RESUME.md), [runtime](RUNTIME-EVIDENCE.md), [security](SECURITY-CODE-REVIEW.md). Implementers must read this file; API changes require coordinator + affected implementer agreement. Design evidence: [front](frontend-flow.md), [data](data-architecture.md), [security](security-review.md). Contract changes must be announced to affected implementers.

## Scope and product decisions

- User update: main frontend develop must become the latest unified Storefront from chat «большой сайт» (showcase + actual product), recovered from preserved2026-10-02 stash, then receive this integration. Storefront is the primary target; Work3 is a supporting design source, not an override. Preserve useful current develop changes/assets. Preserve mobile and desktop learning layouts, root landing and authenticated/new-user entry routing. Final running stack includes the large site. Stash recovery must retain all original snapshots and current integration work; see WORKLOG hashes.

- Separate front (Next), back (Spring/PostgreSQL), AI (FastAPI). Preserve existing auth/session/email verification; reconcile origin/feature/email-ops V1–V4 before V5+. Quizzes remain mocks and cannot award server progress.
- Real-API onboarding must bypass the preexisting unfinished `/lesson` and decorative streak screen: ready → existing registration/save-progress → registration/login → await persisted onboarding → real HOME. Already authenticated users use the existing persistence/entry path without a registration loop. Explicit mock mode may retain those demonstration screens. v1.6 changes UI routing only; no new guest API or fake progress.
- Product format `ege-profile-20-v1`: 20 positions using the current [catalog](https://math-ege.sdamgia.ru/prob_catalog); all source topics seeded with stable IDs/source links. Explicitly labelled original synthetic task fixtures across all positions; no claim to import the site's entire task bank.
- Numbers: 1 planimetry, 2 vectors, 3 solid geometry, 4 basic probability, 5 compound probability, 6 statistics, 7 equations, 8 transformations, 9 derivative, 10 applied problems, 11 word problems, 12 function graphs, 13 financial math; extended 14 equations, 15 solid geometry, 16 inequalities, 17 economy, 18 planimetry, 19 parameters, 20 numbers.
- AI routing prepared for every extended position. Existing approved #16 pipeline only; other packages remain unimplemented by explicit user decision. Missing capability is `unsupported`, never a fake grade. Adding an approved AI capability must not require frontend/backend special-case code.
- Mock AI outputs explicitly marked demonstration; they verify plumbing, not mathematical quality. No paid provider calls in tests. Original provider settings and approved prompts preserved.
- Official draft2027 maxima: 1–13=1; 14=2,15=3,16=2,17=2,18=3,19=4,20=4, total33; [FIPI source](https://doc.fipi.ru/ege/demoversii-specifikacii-kodifikatory/2027/ma_11_2027.zip), specification §10. Persist draft/source/version.
- Score = earned primary points / maximum. No invented 100-point conversion. Partial, rejected, failed, unsupported and unanswered remain distinct. A task is solved only at full points.
- Registered date = existing users.created_at. Preparation level, plan are lookup relations; favourites/solved tasks are per-user relations, not global task booleans or user arrays.
- Default timezone Europe/Moscow. One day with an accepted graded submission qualifies for streak, even if score is zero; quizzes, uploads, errors, synthetic tasks and mock-provider results do not. Store activity days and server streak projection. Training minutes use bounded idempotent activity events, not client-supplied totals.

## Home: saved collections (user update)

- Authenticated home replaces the daily-task card with all unfinished training collections and exam attempts, newest updated first. Public Storefront remains the approved landing page.
- Collection = persisted Attempt, not a temporary client selection: stable ID, owner, immutable ordered task versions, saved answers/drawings/photos, per-item results and currentIndex. Multiple unfinished collections coexist.
- Each card shows type/title, checked/total progress, pending status and exact resume action. Reload, logout/login or another device restore that exact attempt. Never route to mock lesson or create a replacement attempt on resume. Empty list has honest empty state + catalog action, no misleading Continue.
- Both training and exam are Attempt entities. HOME explicitly distinguishes «Продолжить подборку №16» (multiple numbers listed when selected) from «Продолжить пробник» with its title; never an ambiguous generic resume label. This v1.5 clarification changes UI wording only, not schema/API.
- GET `/api/attempts?status=unfinished` filters active/checking, orders updatedAt DESC; bounded pagination. Failed/rejected/unsupported or missing-input items keep unfinished attempts resumable; only fully graded attempts complete automatically. Existing `stats.resumeAttempt` may remain compatibility data, but home does not substitute one UUID for the list.
- Browser acceptance: two distinct collections + exam, partially answer/upload/check, leave/relogin/reload, resume each with matching progress/draft/index; new user has no Continue fallback.
- Delivery includes actual DB schema guide/ER diagram and protected browsing access, with private media metadata distinguished from S3 bytes.

## Boundaries and invariants

- Browser uses same-origin `/api`, current apiFetch, SESSION+CSRF. Backend derives user from session; client cannot set user/role/plan/score/streak/answer key/provider/S3 key. No secrets in NEXT_PUBLIC.
- Feature-first backend: catalog, attempt, grading, media, profile. Controller → application service → repository; external ports ObjectStorage and GradingGateway. Worker HTTP outside DB transactions. No new broker/Redis.
- UUIDs are strings in public JSON; timestamps ISO8601 UTC. Task ID is canonical; taskVersionId immutable; attemptItemId identifies a specific occurrence. Draft revisions are optimistic locks. All object reads/mutations scoped by owner; ADMIN separately checked against current enabled user.
- Public Task DTO excludes accepted answers/reference solution. Reference is revealed only by the checked-item result endpoint. Published task content and attempt membership remain immutable.
- Exam template contains exactly 20 positions. Creating an attempt atomically snapshots task versions/order; new attempt starts empty. History is never replaced by a later attempt.
- `isFavourite` is a per-user projection. Favourite from an exam resolves through the same task catalog. No migration of browser mock scores into real progress; clear/isolate old user-global localStorage and caches on logout/account switch.
- Errors preserve Spring ProblemDetail `{type,title,status,detail,code,requestId,fieldErrors?}` with bounded safe text; frontend adapter reads detail and existing auth errors compatibly. 400 validation, 401 session, 403 permission/CSRF, 404 missing or foreign object, 409 revision/idempotency/availability conflict, 413 bytes, 422 unsupported/unprocessable, 429 limits, 503 dependency unavailable. No raw upstream errors.

Auth existing routes preserved. Public tariff changes/OAuth demo identities cannot grant actual access. Local-only demo setup seeds users through an explicit development mechanism; production has no hardcoded login.

## Shared DTOs

- Frozen enums: `gradingCapability=available|unsupported|unavailable`; `Attempt.status=active|checking|completed`; `Task.progressStatus=unstarted|in-progress|solved`; `Stats.week=[{date,qualified,minutes}]`. Capability unavailable means dependency/registry unavailable, unsupported means no approved handler.

- Task: `{id,taskVersionId,version,examNumber,part,topicIds,difficulty,responseType:'short'|'photo',maxPoints,content:TaskBlock[],isFavourite,progressStatus,gradingCapability,isDemo,sourceYear}`. Existing TaskBlock text/latex/image representation retained. Image URLs server-controlled.
- Attempt: `{id,kind:'training'|'mock-exam',templateId?,formatId,status,revision,currentIndex,createdAt,updatedAt,completedAt?,items,summary}`; item `{id,task,answer,drawing,answerRevision,submission?,result?}`. Summary `{total,answered,graded,earnedPoints,maxPoints,pending,unsupported}`; incomplete scoring labelled.
- Attachment: `{id,fileName,mimeType,sizeBytes,status,previewUrl}`. Filenames bounded metadata only; keys server-generated. Actual File bytes uploaded immediately, not discarded after name extraction.
- Submission: `{id,attemptId,attemptItemId,inputRevision,revision,status,images,createdAt,updatedAt,result?,errorCode?,retryable,isDemo}`. Status `draft|queued|running|graded|rejected|failed|cancelled|expired|unsupported`.
- Result: `{isGraded,score:null|number,maxScore,feedback?,rejectionReason?,isDemo}`. Feedback is typed projection of validated OCR/analysis/grading, excludes raw AI task/ethalon and transport internals. Exact AI JSON is storage/admin only; reference reveal uses explicit endpoint. Failure/reject/unsupported has score null.
- Profile: `{id,email,displayName,registeredAt,avatarUrl?,goalId,levelId,dailyGoalMinutes,timeZone,notificationsEnabled,plan,features}`. Existing UserResponse mapping may add these fields without leaking auth internals. Front goal/level codes retained from onboarding config.

## Upload and asynchronous checking

1. First photo selection creates idempotent durable submission intent before sending bytes. Preflight errors are reported through a bounded intent rejection operation; backend repeats all authoritative checks. Unsent browser events cannot be guaranteed in server history.
2. Backend bounds request bytes, sniffs/decode/re-encodes static images, strips EXIF; solution accepts JPEG/PNG/WebP, ≤8MiB, ≤20MP, dimension≤8192, ≤4 images. Avatar stricter. Unsupported/corrupt/oversize input saves reason/metadata, never dangerous raw bytes. Disconnected uploads expire visibly. Reserve file slots atomically (staged+ready≤4), upload outside transaction, READY commit rechecks draft/revision. Finalize requires matching revision and no staged uploads; upload/delete increments revision.
3. Store normalized image in private S3 using official SDK, immutable generated key; DB metadata staged→ready. Orphan cleanup/reconciliation, no public ACL. AI gets bytes, not URLs/S3 credentials. Storage failures retain intent/error.
4. Finalize commits snapshot+event+queue atomically. Postgres worker claims with SKIP LOCKED, bounded concurrency, lease/fencing. Commit dispatch record before HTTP with CAS on claimed state, fencing token and unexpired lease; failed CAS forbids HTTP dispatch. No transaction held while waiting ≤360s AI deadline.
5. No automatic retry after uncertain dispatch/timeout/crash. Explicit retry creates a new submission with owner/item-checked retryOfId linked to a terminal failed/rejected/cancelled/unsupported predecessor; terminal history is immutable. Polling/reload restore queued/running state. Browser close does not cancel.
6. Backend validates AI contract, task/image IDs, score bounds and graded/null consistency before accepting. Each AI response must carry checked provider mode and package ID; store with run, never infer mode solely from cached capabilities. Atomic result/event/progress update; stale workers cannot overwrite cancellation/result or award twice.
7. Every accepted intent has lifecycle events: validation failures, unsupported, uploads, dispatch, rejection/attack, timeout and final response. Early proxy/auth/CSRF failures have security logs; never claim the DB records requests it did not receive. Admin can inspect structured text and private photos safely.

## AI boundary

Exact internal contract follows [ai-contract.md](ai-contract.md); Adapter response≤1MiB before parse, total HTTP deadline≤390s, redirects/retries disabled; mandatory per-response X-Grading-Provider-Mode and X-Grading-Package-Id checked against pinned capability. Service token fail-closed, route excluded from public ingress, no browser cookies or user PII. Registry covers14..20; #16 reuses approved Session/tools/validator, prepared server task bypasses task-image OCR only. Standalone service remains compatible. Capability response drives availability; no frontend per-number AI branches.

## Runtime and delivery gates

- PostgreSQL17, private S3-compatible local service, AI mock, backend, frontend proxy; Adminer loopback only. See runtime-plan.md for pinned images, paths and rollback. Dependencies outside existing frontend stack are unnecessary.
- Preserve V1–V4 checksums, auth users/sessions/email state. New migrations V5+. Test V4 upgrade with fixtures and backup restore before production changes. No down -v, Flyway repair or destructive schema replacement.
- Tests: auth/CSRF; two-user ownership; all20 taxonomy and exact20 exam; counts/shortage; reload/history/favourites; private S3 avatar/photo; invalid uploads persisted; repeated finalize; worker race/crash; AI timeout/malformed/wrong IDs/no score; role/admin; no mock success in real mode.
- Front lint/typecheck/build + browser QA small/large viewport: registration/login, multi-number selection, short check, real photo bytes→mock AI16, unsupported14..20, attempt reload, history, favourites, avatar/profile and admin. Quizzes unchanged.
- Separate isolated server mock smoke before replacing any live route. Preserve provider env, develop/gateway isolation and production rollback. Report separately what is tested locally, on server, and not verified with a paid model.
